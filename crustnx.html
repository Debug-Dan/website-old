<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>CrustNX</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">CrustNX is an optimized CFW Package for the Nintendo Switch. It contains more than just the basics but leaves out junk! CrustNX is most optimized for users who want to use EmuNAND to keep their SysNAND safe and secure, but it still works amazingly for everyone else! Check it out <a href="https://github.com/Debug-Dan/CrustNX">here</a>. It was last updated for system version 10 (at the time of writing, this is the newest major version).</p>
