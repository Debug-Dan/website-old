<h2 style="text-align: center;">Rufus Anarchy</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">I had a custom Minecraft server that goes by the name "Rufus Anarchy." The server has since then been shut down (due to a lack of players). I know some of you might still want an archive of the server world, so that's what I did. You can download the world and plugin folders <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/133Yy0tLAX48hnbbHVuD-ayED7s1dEN01?usp=sharing">here</a>. Please note that many aspects, such as the server jar, config, and other main server files are not included. If you are interested in hosting the server yourself, I recommend Shockbyte (not sponsored), as it performs very well for a cheap price. At the time of shutdown, the server ran Paper Spigot 1.15.2, so I would recommend using that version (old versions wouldn't have the additions in newer updates, and newer versions likely won't be compatable with the plugins provided, and will probably need updating).</p>
